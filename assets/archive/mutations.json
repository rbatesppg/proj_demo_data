Affected dogs typically present with symptoms of neurologic disease around 5 to 6 months of age. Dogs with GM1 gangliosidosis have insufficient activity of the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which is responsible for breaking down specific carbohydrates in the cells. As a result, there is an accumulation of break down products such as GM1 in cells, especially cells of the brain and nervous system. Symptoms include vision loss, difficulties walking, loss of balance, head tremors, lethargy and weight loss. By 9 to 12 months of age affected dogs are lethargic, have cloudy corneas, and may have involuntary muscle contractions. Dogs usually die by 15 months of age.",

As the disease progresses, dogs may lose sensory skills and vision. Signs of dementia may include loss of learned behavior, irritability and aggression.

The muscle cells of an affected dog are over-excitable, which causes muscles to remain contracted rather than relaxing after voluntary activity. Signs of the disorder usually present when puppies begin to walk. Their gait may appear stiff and uncoordinated and they may fall frequently. Affected dogs frequently have a “bunny hop” type gait. Episodes do not appear to be painful and the muscle stiffness may improve with increased exercise. Episodes can worsen with hot weather and excitement. Other features include enlargement of the muscles, especially of the neck and limbs, abnormal posture, and an upper jaw that is much longer than the lower jaw. Dogs with this disorder typically have a normal lifespan.",

Affected dogs have insufficient activity of the enzyme hexosaminidase B, which is responsible for breaking down specific carbohydrates in the cells. As a result, there is an accumulation of a glycoprotein, GM2 ganglioside, in cells, especially cells of the brain and nervous system. Affected dogs typically present with symptoms of neurologic disease around 9 to 12 months of age. Symptoms include vision loss, difficulties walking, loss of balance, head tremors and vomiting. Once an affected dog begins to show signs of the disease, the disease progression is rapid and dogs usually die between the ages of 18 and 23 months.",

Symptoms included a lack of muscle coordination, abnormal gait, and difficulty balancing and jumping. The dog also displayed signs of dementia including aimless wandering behavior with episodes of confusion, depression, aggressive behavior, loss of learned behavior, blindness, seizures and frequent barking.

Affected dogs typically develop increased eye pressure in both eyes between 8 to 16 months of age. As the pressure in the eye increases, the eyeball increases in size and is painful. Signs of pain in the eye include excessive blinking, tearing and redness. If left untreated, the increased pressure in the eye leads to optic nerve damage and the gradual loss of vision. Most dogs exhibit luxation of the lens of the eye by 2.5 years of age. Symptoms of lens luxation include excessive blinking, squinting and tearing of the eye. Dislocation of the lens can occur in both the forward and backward position within the eye, but dislocation in the forward position is more common and serious. If not treated immediately, lens dislocation will exasperate the glaucoma and vision loss. Other symptoms may include bulging eyes and cataracts.",

Affected dogs bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, bleed from the mouth spontaneously or when juvenile teeth are lost, and experience prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. The bleeding may be severe enough to cause death. Dogs that have one copy of the mutation (carriers) also have decreased amounts of vWf but there is variability in the levels such that not all carriers are equally affected. Dogs that have less than 35% of the normal amount of vWf have mild to moderate signs of a bleeding disorder. Due to the variable severity of the disorder, carrier dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted. However, most carrier dogs will not show symptoms of increased bleeding. Veterinarians performing surgery on known affected or carrier dogs should have ready access to blood banked for transfusions. Most carrier dogs will have a normal lifespan with this condition despite the possibility of having increased blood clotting times.

The choroid is the layer of tissue in the eye responsible for supplying blood and nutrients to the retina. In dogs affected with CEA, the choroid does not develop properly and is therefore thinner than normal often leading to retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. The severity of the condition can vary from dog to dog. Mildly affected dogs may have thinning of the choroid with normal vision, while severely affected dogs may have additional eye problems, such as colobomas, retinal detachment, intraocular hemorrhage, and significant vision loss including complete blindness. Because both mild and severe forms of CEA are associated with the same NHEJ1 gene mutation, predicting the potential severity of the disease in an affected dog is difficult e.g., a mildly affected dog may produce offspring that are severely affected.",

        "commonSymptoms" : """Multidrug resistance 1, also called MDR1, is an inherited condition affecting several breeds of dogs, especially herding dogs or descendants of herding breeds. The mutation in the ABCB1 gene associated with MDR1 causes dysfunction of P-glycoprotein, which is responsible for removing certain drugs and toxins from the body. Clinical signs are most commonly associated with distribution of the drug in the central nervous system. If an at-risk dog is treated with one of several common drugs (see below*), they are at risk of developing neurologic symptoms that could range from tremors, excess salivation, anorexia, and blindness to coma and even death. Because of the defective ability to metabolize specific drugs, these drugs can be lethal even at low doses. The MDR1 mutation does not cause adverse effects in dogs unless the dog is exposed to these drugs. Therefore, veterinarians should be notified when a dog is at risk for multidrug resistance 1 prior to administration of any medications.<br><br>↵<strong>*Drugs known to cause neurological signs related to the MDR1 mutation:</strong><br>
Acepromazine, butorphanol, doxorubicin, emodepside, erythromycin, ivermectin, loperamide, milbemycin, moxidectin, rifampin, selamectin, vinblastine and vincristine.<br><br>
In addition to this list, there are many other drugs known to be removed from the central nervous system via the P-glycoprotein mechanism in humans. However, reports of neurological dysfunction related to drugs other than those listed here are scarce in dogs. Please consult your veterinarian prior to giving drugs to known multidrug resistance carriers, affected dogs, or untested dogs of breeds commonly affected with this condition.

Affected dogs typically present with clinical signs of abnormal kidney function in adulthood with an average age of onset between four and eight years of age. Normally the kidneys reabsorb most of the nutrients and electrolytes that they filter from the blood. The kidneys of affected dogs do not properly reabsorb nutrients and electrolytes, such as glucose, protein, phosphate, potassium and sodium, and abnormally lose these nutrients in the urine. Symptoms of abnormal kidney function in affected dogs most commonly include increased urination and excessive drinking. Less often dogs may have weight loss despite a normal appetite, weakness, urinary incontinence and poor hair coat. A common characteristic of this disease is glucose in the urine with normal blood glucose levels. Fanconi syndrome is treatable but not curable. If an affected dog is not treated, the disease can progress to chronic kidney failure and overall poor health. Appropriate treatment can preserve the health and quality of life of affected dogs. The median survival time after diagnosis is five years with most dogs dying around 12 years of age. This late age of onset allows for most dogs to be bred before diagnosis and subsequently, the disease is passed to offspring.",

Dogs with two copies of H die in utero.,	Interpretation: Embryonic lethal""",
        "detailedSummary" : "Harlequin is a specific coat color pattern marked by patches of full color on a white background. This patterning is a result of the interaction of two different genes,  the merle (M locus) gene,  PMEL,  and a modifier gene,  PSMB7,  at the harlequin (H locus). Dogs that have one copy of H in addition to one copy of M will have the characteristic harlequin coat color pattern. A dog with one copy of H but two copies of M (double merle) has a coat color that can be indistinguishable from a dog without the harlequin variant. While the harlequin coat color is not considered a defect,  breeding studies indicate that inheriting two copies of the H gene variant is not compatible with life. Puppies with two copies of the PSMB7 gene variant (H/H) most likely die very early in gestation; therefore,  breeding two dogs with harlequin coat color (H/h) may result in reduced litter size.",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the <em>PSMB7</em> gene will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of the harlequin coat color. Harlequin coat color is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in dogs meaning that dogs only need to inherit one copy of the variant gene to have the characteristic harlequin coat color. Each pup that is born to a dog with the harlequin coat color has a 50% chance of inheriting one copy of the <em>PSMB7</em> gene variant (H) and having a harlequin coat color. Breeding of two dogs with harlequin coat color is not recommended as this condition appears to be lethal in offspring that inherit two copies of the variant. These types of breedings may generate small litters or no offspring. Mantle colored dogs with either one copy or no copies of the harlequin gene are physically indistinguishable from each other. This genetic test will allow for identification of mantle colored dogs with one copy of the harlequin gene to prevent breeding them to another dog carrying a harlequin gene and thus, decreasing chances of embryological death of puppies. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to avoid producing homozygous pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended.",

Affected dogs lack adequate activity of a specific enzyme necessary for normal cellular metabolism. As a result, there is an abnormal accumulation of waste compounds primarily in the cells of the nervous system, leading to a range of nervous system disorders. Affected dogs typically present between 15 and 20 months of age with behavioral changes. Symptoms initially include non-responsiveness to commands, loss of interest in play or other dogs, irrational fears, hallucinations, disorientation and aggression. Symptoms become more frequent and severe over time and may include ataxia, falling, seizures, aimless wandering, abnormal gait, lethargy and vision loss. Dogs with this disease rarely live beyond 32 months of age.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Copper storage disease is an inherited metabolic condition affecting Bedlington Terriers. This disease is characterized by chronic copper accumulation leading to eventual copper toxicosis. Affected dogs are often asymptomatic up to 5 to 6 years of age after which they present with clinical signs of either acute liver failure or chronic liver failure. During this asymptomatic period copper continually accumulates in the liver and slowly damages liver cells. If only a few liver cells are damaged at a time, the liver can repair itself by regeneration or fibrosis. Chronic liver failure, the most common outcome of copper storage disease in Bedlington Terriers, occurs when there are not enough liver cells left to perform the normal functions of the liver. Chronic liver failure secondary to copper storage disease tends to occur in older dogs and signs of disease often include a pendulous abdomen from abdominal fluid accumulation, excessive thirst and urination and weight loss in addition to jaundice, lethargy, loss of appetite, depression and vomiting. Prognosis of the chronic form varies based upon the extent of liver damage when initially presented. Acute liver failure and hemolysis are less common outcomes of copper storage disease. This presentation usually occurs in younger dogs, and when an affected dog experiences a stressful event, such as whelping, air transport, kenneling or showing and the copper stores in the liver are released all at once. This sudden release of copper damages high numbers of liver cells and red blood cells all at once leading to liver and kidney failure. Signs of acute liver failure and hemolysis include jaundice, lethargy, loss of appetite, depression and vomiting. Dogs may also have decreased urine production, red-brown urine and a painful abdomen. This is an immediately life threating form of copper toxicosis with many dogs dying within 48 to 72 hours of initial symptoms despite treatment. If copper storage disease is not identified early and lifelong treatment is not started, most affected dogs die around three to seven years of age.",

Dogs remain mentally alert and are not in pain during episodes of EIC. In some circumstances, the symptoms of EIC can progress to full body weakness with low muscle tone (flaccid paralysis), confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures and very rarely, death.

It can result in inflammation (cholecystitis) and possible rupture of the gallbladder. Affected dogs usually present with vomiting, jaundice, loss of appetite and abdominal pain. If the gallbladder is not removed before rupture, the dog will become very painful and die. Though it is known that dogs inheriting one copy of the causal mutation are at increased risk for this disease, the presentation of gallbladder mucoceles is variable between dogs and not all dogs inheriting a copy of the mutation will develop the disease. This suggests that there are environmental or other genetic factors responsible for modifying disease expression.

Affected dogs can also bruise easily, get blood filled masses (hematomas) under their skin and within muscles with mild trauma. They can have internal bleeding and bloody or dark tarry feces. Dogs may show signs of lameness or stiffness if bleeding in the joints is present. Although dogs with this disorder are at risk for spontaneous hemorrhage and internal bleeding, affected dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted. Veterinarians performing surgery on known affected dogs should have ready access to blood banked for transfusions. Dogs can have a normal lifespan with this condition although they are susceptible to life-threatening bleeding with an accidental injury or any surgical procedure.",

Dogs with this disease usually start showing symptoms of chronic kidney disease between 6 months and 2 years of age. Normally protein is not present in the urine, but in affected dogs there is a defect that allows protein from the blood to be filtered by the kidneys and lost in the urine. Abnormal amounts of protein can be detected in the urine as early as five months of age. Symptoms of chronic kidney disease include excessive thirst and urination, vomiting, inappetence, weight loss, weakness and fatigue. If drinking excessively, some dogs may also inappropriately urinate in the house or in a crate. Affected dogs eventually die of chronic kidney failure within a year.",

Affected dogs may bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, bleed from the mouth when juvenile teeth are lost and experience prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. The bleeding may be severe enough to cause death. Due to variable severity of the disorder, affected dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted. Veterinarians performing surgery on known affected dogs should have ready access to blood banked for transfusions.

This muscle spasticity results in a characteristic “praying” position and/or collapse. Episodes are usually a few seconds to several minutes in length and resolve on their own.

        "commonSymptoms" : "Hereditary cataracts (Australian Shepherd type) is an inherited eye disease affecting dogs. Cataracts are opacities in the lens of the eye caused by structural changes in lens proteins. A normal lens allows light to pass through it to the retina in the back of the eye. Light cannot pass through the parts of the lens affected by cataracts and vision becomes blurry. Dogs with Hereditary cataracts (Australian Shepherd type) most commonly present between 2 to 7 years of age with small cataracts that are visible on a veterinary eye exam. In dogs that inherit one copy of the mutation, cataracts develop slowly, sometimes leading to complete blindness. However, it has been speculated that dogs carrying two copies of the mutation are more likely to develop a more rapidly progressing and severe cataract.  Of note, not all forms of cataracts are inherited and environmental factors such as UV damage can also play a role in the severity of disease. This specific mutation in the HSF4 gene shows incomplete penetrance, meaning that not all dogs inheriting two copies of the mutation develop clinical disease. This suggests that other unknown genetic or environmental factors may play a role in modifying disease development and progression.",

Hereditary cataracts (Australian Shepherd type) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in dogs meaning that dogs only need to inherit one copy of the mutated gene to be at-risk for the disease. Dogs that inherit two copies of the genetic mutation are at-risk of developing a more severe form of the disease. Each pup that is born to a parent carrying one copy of the mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting one copy of the HSF4 gene mutation and being at-risk for the disease. If both parents are affected, the chance of having affected offspring increases to 75-100%. Because symptoms may not appear until adulthood and not all dogs with the mutation develop disease, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers is not recommended.

Abnormalities can be seen on an electroretinogram by 5 weeks of age.  However, diagnosis during a standard veterinary ophthalmic exam is not typically possible until 10 months to 3 years of age. In affected dogs, cone cells degenerate first resulting in blindness in bright light (“day blindness”).

Affected dogs bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, bleed from the mouth spontaneously or when juvenile teeth are lost, and experience prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. The bleeding may be severe enough to cause death. Dogs that have one copy of the mutation (carriers) also have decreased amounts of vWf but there is variability in the levels such that not all carriers are equally affected. Dogs that have less than 35% of the normal amount of vWf have mild to moderate signs of a bleeding disorder. Due to the variable severity of the disorder, carrier dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted. However, most carrier dogs will not show symptoms of increased bleeding. Veterinarians performing surgery on known affected or carrier dogs should have ready access to blood banked for transfusions. Most carrier dogs will have a normal lifespan with this condition despite the possibility of having increased blood clotting times.

Affected dogs initially present between 2 and 5 years of age with vision loss in dim light (night blindness) and loss of peripheral vision, gradually progressing to complete vision loss.

        "commonSymptoms" : "Early retinal degeneration (ERD) is an inherited eye disease affecting dogs. ERD usually presents at 3 to 10 weeks of age as general poor vision and night blindness. Affected puppies may appear to move more cautiously than littermates and have a tendency to bump into objects. ERD occurs as a result of abnormal development and degeneration of photoreceptor cells (rod and cone cells) of the retina, which are responsible for sensing light and transmitting signals to the brain, resulting in vision. The disease initially progresses rapidly, but progression slows after 6 months of age. Dogs become totally blind between 12 to 18 months of age. Between 4-5 years of age, affected dogs also develop cataracts.",

Affected dogs lack activity of an enzyme that is important in the production of thyroid hormone which is necessary for the normal development and metabolism of dogs. As early as 2 weeks of age, dogs with CHG are generally noted to have reduced movement and to be small when compared to their littermates. By four weeks of age, affected dogs are about half the size of normal littermates and begin to develop enlargements of the thyroid gland (goiter) visible on the underside of the neck. Affected puppies exhibit dwarfism with short legs, large heads, and fluffy coats absent of guard hairs. In addition, affected dogs develop a wide variety of neurological and neuromuscular deficits. The condition progresses to failure to thrive and death. Most symptoms can be prevented or will regress if the condition is diagnosed early and affected dogs are treated with thyroid hormone medication. However, the thyroid glands may continue to enlarge over time despite treatment and can eventually obstruct the dog&rsquo;s airway.</p>",

Normal kidneys reabsorb the amino acid cystine so that only small amounts pass into the urine, while dogs with mutations of both copies of the SLC3A1 gene fail to reabsorb cystine allowing large amounts to pass into the urine, hence the name cystinuria. Cystine can form crystals and/or stones in the urinary tract, which can block the ureters or urethra and stop the normal flow of urine. Affected male dogs typically present with symptoms related to cysteine bladder stones at 6 to 14 months of age, however female dogs tend to develop symptoms later than males. Symptoms of disease include straining to urinate, frequent urination of small volumes or inability to urinate. In Labrador Retrievers, males and females are equally affected with excess cysteine in the urine, but obstruction of urine flow is more common in males due to differences in anatomy and females tend to develop stones about a year later than males on average. Dogs with cystinuria often have recurrent inflammation of the urinary tract and if not treated, urinary stones can cause urinary tract infections, kidney failure and even death.</p>",

This disease shows incomplete penetrance, meaning that not all dogs at risk (those with one or two copies of the mutation) will develop the disease. In affected dogs, the heart muscle is weak and the chambers become dilated with thin walls. These enlarged hearts have poor contractility and are prone to arrhythmias. Affected dogs present with clinical signs of poor heart function between 1 to 8 years of age. Affected dogs develop clinical signs as they age ranging from mild exercise intolerance to sudden death or congestive heart failure. Signs of heart disease include exercise intolerance, fatigue, coughing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, fainting and sudden death. Affected dogs that don’t die suddenly from arrhythmias usually die from congestive heart failure around 7 years of age. Different disease genes and environmental factors play a role the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs. Therefore not all dogs with this disease will have the same genetic mutation.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "<p>Cystinuria (Australian Cattle Dog type) is an inherited disease affecting kidney function dogs. The SLC3A1 gene codes for a protein that allows the kidneys to transport cysteine and other amino acids from the urine. Normal kidneys reabsorb the amino acid cystine so that only small amounts pass into the urine, while dogs with mutations of both copies of the SLC3A1 gene fail to reabsorb cystine allowing large amounts to pass into the urine, hence the name cystinuria. Cystine can form crystals and/or stones in the urinary tract which can block the ureters or urethra and stop the normal flow of urine. Symptoms of disease include straining to urinate, frequent urination of small volumes or inability to urinate. In dogs, males and females are equally affected with excess cysteine in the urine, but obstruction of urine flow is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Similar to other dominant diseases, affected dogs have variable onset and severity of clinical signs depending on the number of inherited copies of the cystinuria associated mutation. Dogs inheriting two copies of the mutation (one from each parent) have a higher concentration of cysteine in their urine than dogs with only one copy and tend to develop symptoms associated with cystinuria earlier. Dogs with cystinuria often have recurrent inflammation of the urinary tract and if not treated, urinary stones can cause urinary tract infections, kidney failure and even death.</p>",

Affected dogs have an increase in certain proteins in their urine, and have decreased synthesis of blood cells resulting in anemia and decreased numbers of neutrophils.

        "commonSymptoms" : "Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy is an inherited disease affecting Golden Retrievers. Affected dogs are unable to produce adequate amounts of a protein important for muscle contraction and relaxation. By 10 weeks of age affected puppies are noticeably smaller than littermates shortly after birth due to decreased growth associated with the inability to nurse. Affected dogs often need to be hand or bottle fed to prevent starvation. Beginning around 6 weeks of age, dogs begin to develop a progressively abnormal gait, muscle weakness, excessive drooling, muscle atrophy of the head and trunk, abnormal extension or flexion of joints and a “roach backed” appearance in the lumbar spine that eventually progresses to a concave flexion. Affected dogs may also suffer from aspiration pneumonia and cardiac disease. The prognosis is related to disease severity with some dogs dying soon after birth due to disease complications and others surviving for years with only mild symptoms.",

Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the ADAM9 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because symptoms do not appear until adulthood, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Glen of Imaal Terriers that are not found to have this specific mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups. However, because there are multiple types of progressive retinal atrophy caused by mutations in other genes, a normal result in ADAM9 does not exclude progressive retinal atrophy in a pedigree.",

Megaesophagus causes regurgitation and vomiting and predisposes dogs to aspiration pneumonia. Over time the muscle weakness and regurgitation/vomiting worsen. Dogs may also have an unusual sounding bark, pant excessively and have difficulty breathing. Dogs usually are euthanized or die of heart failure by 1.5 years of age.",

The SLC7A9 gene codes for a protein that allows the kidneys to transport cysteine and other amino acids from the urine. Normal kidneys reabsorb the amino acid cystine so that only small amounts pass into the urine, while dogs with mutations of both copies of the SLC7A9 gene fail to reabsorb cystine allowing high amounts to pass into the urine, hence the name cystinuria. Cystine can form crystals and/or stones in the urinary tract which can block the ureters or urethra and stop the normal flow of urine. Affected male dogs present with symptoms related to cysteine bladder stones around one year of age, however female dogs tend to develop symptoms later than males. Symptoms of disease include straining to urinate, frequent urination of small volumes or inability to urinate. In miniature pinschers, males and females are equally affected with excess cysteine in the urine, but obstruction of urine flow is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Dogs with cystinuria often have recurrent inflammation of the urinary tract and if not treated, urinary stones can cause urinary tract infections, kidney failure and even death.</p>",

Dogs identified to have the genetic mutation are expected to have features of the disease, though symptoms can be very mild and dogs may appear healthy. Each pup that is born to a single affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting one copy of the SLC7A9 gene mutation and having the disease. If both parents are affected, the chance of having affected offspring increases to 75-100%. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices.

Affected dogs typically present between 1 to 9 weeks of age depending on the breed with signs of neurologic disease. Affected puppies are smaller than littermates and symptoms initially start with tremors and progress to ataxia as the puppies learn to walk. They have difficulty controlling leg movements and keeping their balance until they eventually can’t walk. Later in the course of disease they may have difficulty eating, salivate excessively, and have seizures. Affected puppies that do not die on their own are euthanized within 15 weeks of age due to a poor quality of life.",

Spongiform leukoencephalomyelopathy is a mitochondrial disorder. Dogs only inherit mitochondrial DNA from the mother. Because this disease is inherited in a maternal inheritance pattern, both male and female dogs must inherit the mutated gene from the mother to develop the disease. Affected male dogs do not pass their mitochondrial DNA to their offspring and cannot produce affected pups. Each pup that is born to a female dog carrying a mutation in the CYTB gene is at risk of having the disease. However, the ratio of mitochondria without the mutation to the number of mitochondria with the mutation is important in determining whether a specific dog will actually develop features of the disease. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because disease presentation is variable, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of carrier or affected dogs is not recommended. Female dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

        "detailedSummary" : "The two major pigments that impact canine coat color are eumelanin (black pigment) and phaeomelanin (yellow/red pigment). These pigments are produced within specialized cells called melanocytes located in the canine epidermis and hair follicles. Within the melanocyte,  the pigments are made in tiny organelles called melanosomes. The melanosomes are continually being transferred from the melanocytes to the surrounding keratinocyte cells that make up the hair and skin, thereby giving the skin and hair specific color based on the type of pigment they contain. The <em>MC1R</em> gene, also known as the extension (E) locus,  controls the production of eumelanin (black pigment) in the melanocytes. The dominant form of the <em>MC1R</em> gene (E) allows for normal production of eumelanin in the melanocytes. However,  a DNA variant in the <em>MC1R</em> gene (e) shuts down production of eumelanin (black pigment) in the melanocytes leaving only the production of phaeomelanin (yellow/red pigment) in the melanocytes. Because e is recessive,  two copies of this <em>MC1R</em> e variant must be present to express the solid “yellow/red” coat color. A dog that has two copies of E (E/E) will not have a yellow/red coat and will not be capable of passing on a yellow/red coat color allele to its offspring. A dog that has one copy of E and one copy of e (E/e) will not have a yellow/red coat but will pass on the yellow/red coat color gene e or the black coat color gene E to 50% of its offspring. A dog that has two copies of e (e/e) will have a yellow/red coat and can only pass on the yellow/red coat color gene e to its offspring.",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the <em>MC1R</em> gene will determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of yellow/red coat color. Located at the top of the known canine coat color genetic interaction flowchart, the E locus is dominant to all other coat color loci. Dogs with an e/e coat color genotype will have some variation of red, apricot, yellow, cream or white coat coloration depending on the breed and other genetic factors but will not be black or brown. Yellow/red coat color is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that dogs need to inherit two copies of the e allele to have the characteristic yellow/red coat color. Each pup that is born to a dog with yellow/red coat color has a 100% chance of inheriting one copy of the e variant of the <em>MC1R</em> gene from that parent. To produce only yellow/red pups, both the dam and the sire must be e/e. Dogs with E/E or E/e genotypes will have a black coat color. However, the dog’s coat color is also dependent on the dog’s genotypes at the K, A, and B genes among others.",

In early, in utero development all canine fetuses have precursors of the uterus, fallopian tubes and upper vagina called Müllerian ducts. In normal male fetuses, the Müllerian ducts regress as sexual differentiation occurs in utero allowing for development of male sexual anatomy. In affected male dogs the female reproductive organs fail to regress in utero. Approximately half of the affected male dogs have externally normal testes and are fertile, but internally have remnants of female reproductive organs, including the uterus. The other 50% of affected male dogs have cryptorchidism in addition to remnants of female reproductive structures. Cryptorchidism predisposes dogs to infertility and testicular tumors. Affected dogs may also have small testes. Male dogs may need to have a hysterectomy if the uterus becomes infected. This disorder is limited to expression in males. Females with this condition have normal internal and external female anatomy.",

Affected dogs develop a mild form of “disproportionate dwarfism” consisting of short legs with normal body length and width. The leg bones are shorter, thicker, and slightly curved and the front legs are frequently more affected than rear legs. Joints and eyes are not typically affected with this disease. The height of affected dogs is variable, making diagnosis based on physical characteristics alone challenging in some individuals. Mildly affected dogs from bloodlines known to produce large dogs may still fall within their breed standard for height. The causal mutation shows incomplete penetrance meaning that not all dogs inheriting two copies (one from each parent) will display obvious physical characteristics of dwarfism.",

Skeletal dysplasia 2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the COL11A2 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because this mutation shows incomplete penetrance, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended.

The patchiness of the merle coat color is thought to be due to the unstable nature of the M variant which can revert back to the normal m variant in some cells during development giving rise to patches of normal eumelanin producing cells.

Progressive retinal atrophy, rod-cone dysplasia 2 occurs as a result of degeneration of both rod and cone type photoreceptor cells of the retina, which are important for vision in dim and bright light, respectively. Affected dogs have abnormal thinning and degeneration of the retina beginning around 16 days of age. The rod type cells are affected first and affected dogs will initially have vision deficits in dim light (night blindness) and loss of peripheral vision noticeable at about 6 weeks of age.  Other signs of progressive retinal atrophy involve changes in reflectivity and appearance of a structure behind the retina called the tapetum that can be observed at 3.5-4 months of age on a veterinary eye exam. As the disease progresses, cone photoreceptor cells also degenerate resulting in complete blindness by 6 to 8 months of age.",

Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of being a carrier of the RD3 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.

Symptoms of disease include anorexia, lethargy, poor weight gain, poor muscle mass, degenerative liver disease, and in rare circumstances, a severe neurological dysfunction called hepatic encephalopathy that can lead to altered mental state, seizures, coma and death. Affected dogs have an increase in certain proteins in their urine, and have decreased synthesis of blood cells resulting in anemia and decreased numbers of neutrophils. Affected dogs require cobalamin supplementation for life that results in disease remission for most animals within a few weeks.

In addition, affected dogs may also display persistent pupillary membranes, early-onset cataracts, aspiration pneumonia, and/or decreased GI motility. Due to the progressive nature of this disease, most affected dogs die or are humanely euthanized by six months of age.",

        "detailedSummary" : "The T locus (Natural bobtail) impacts the length of the tail in many breeds of dog. A DNA variant in the T gene,  an important gene during early embryogenesis,  disrupts the development of the dog’s tail and can result in a congenitally short (bobtail) or completely absent tail. The natural bobtail variant is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion meaning only one copy of the T gene variant is required to produce a natural bobtail. However,  inheriting two copies of T is not compatible with life causing pups to die in utero. Therefore,  breeding two dogs with natural bobtails (T/t) may result in reduced litter sizes.",

Symptoms include infections of the umbilicus, skin, bones, lungs and uterus as well as gingivitis, impaired wound healing, enlarged lymph nodes and low body weight. On blood work, affected dogs have persistently elevated white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). Without treatment puppies die within a few weeks of age.

In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the ITGB2 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended.

Affected dogs undergo an oscillating cycle in the quantity of a type of white blood cells called neutrophils, important for controlling and preventing bacterial and fungal infections. Affected dogs have neutrophil counts oscillating between normal quantities to almost zero neutrophils on an approximately 2 week frequency. Affected puppies often die within a few days of birth or are stunted in growth. Affected dogs have a gray coat color and are vulnerable to infections during periods of low neutrophil counts. Symptoms associated with this condition are normally seen during or immediately after a period of low neutrophil counts. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, inflamed lymph nodes, gingivitis, lameness and mild bleeding episodes. Even with medical care, most dogs die before 2 years of age due to liver or kidney failure.",

Affected dogs may bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, bleed from the mouth when juvenile teeth are lost, and experience prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. Dogs may show signs of lameness or stiffness if bleeding occurs in the joints or muscle. Less often, the bleeding may be severe enough to cause death. Due to the variable severity of the disorder, affected dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted.

Cleft palate 1 is an inherited developmental defect affecting dogs. Affected dogs are identified shortly after birth with clefts of the hard and soft palate as well as a shortened, malformed jaw. The nasal septum is often absent or underdeveloped in affected dogs. In some cases, asymmetric malformation of the head and face may also occur. Affected dogs are at an increased risk for inhaling food, milk, or water into the lungs leading to potentially life-threatening aspiration pneumonia. Since the clefts formed with this disease do not typically include the upper lip, owners may first recognize a cleft palate after noticing nasal discharge or milk leaking from the nose, gagging or coughing during feeding, or bad breath due to an upper respiratory infection.

At least one other genetic mutation (in the canine ADAMTS20 gene) has also been associated with cleft palate in the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever. Therefore, obtaining normal results on this DLX6 gene test does not completely exclude cleft palate in a pedigree.

Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the AMN gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

Affected dogs present around 2 years of age with intermittent episodes of uncontrolled muscle contractions resulting in repetitive involuntary flexion and extension of the limbs. Hind limbs are more commonly affected than front limbs. However, in severe cases, all four limbs are affected. Though flexing of limbs occurs in just a single leg or alternates from limb to limb in most dogs, some dogs may also experience flexion of both hind limbs simultaneously, resulting in collapse or weight bearing on the front limbs only. Episodes can last from minutes to hours and can occur from several times per day to once every several weeks. Dogs appear normal between episodes. In some dogs, excitement or stress may trigger an episode. The disease progresses with age and dogs are often euthanized within 2 years of diagnosis due to decreased quality of life.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Catalase deficiency is an inherited disease affecting dogs. Catalase is a protein which plays an important role in a variety of metabolic reactions in the body including those involved in the prevention of cellular oxidative damage. Dogs affected with catalase deficiency lack adequate amounts of this protein in red blood cells. Though many dogs with this condition do not show clinical signs of disease, affected dogs are at increased risk of life-threatening ulceration and gangrene (tissue death due to loss of blood supply) of the oral cavity.",
        "testingSummary" : "",
        "detailedSummary" : "",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the CAT gene will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of catalase deficiency. Catalase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the CAT gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because symptoms may not appear until adulthood, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

Affected dogs present around 2 to 4 months of age with rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction due to death of nerve cells in a part of the brain known as the cerebellum, which plays an important role in coordinated movement. Clinical signs include head tremors, delayed or absent reflexes, and uncoordinated movements (ataxia) which become progressively more severe over weeks to months. Affected dogs are often euthanized due to quality of life concerns within a few weeks of the initial clinical signs.",

Affected dogs lack an enzyme that is important in the production of thyroid hormone which is necessary for the normal development and metabolism of dogs. At 3-8 weeks of age, dogs with CHG are generally noted to have reduced movement and to be small when compared to their littermates. Enlarged thyroid glands (goiter) are often noticeable as a swelling on the neck. Affected puppies exhibit dwarfism with short legs, large heads, and fluffy hair coats absent of guard hairs. In addition, affected dogs develop a wide variety of neurological and neuromuscular deficits. The condition progresses to failure to thrive and death. Most symptoms can be prevented or will regress if the condition is diagnosed early and affected dogs are treated with thyroid hormone medication. However, the thyroid glands may continue to enlarge over time despite treatment and can eventually obstruct the dog&rsquo;s airway.</p>",

Affected dogs present by two months of age with severe ulcerations of mucous membranes including those of the mouth, eyes, and respiratory tract resulting in pain and discharge from the eyes and nose. Affected dogs will often display increased respiratory sounds due to severe inflammation of the larynx and trachea.  Enlarged lymph nodes, increased white blood cell counts, protein in the urine, and inadequate amounts of protein in the blood are commonly seen with this disease. Additionally, affected dogs often have severe, chronic inflammatory changes of the membranes lining the chest and abdominal cavities. Some affected dogs may be born with malformation of the cerebellum, a part of the brain associated with coordinated movement. Affected dogs typically die or are euthanized before adulthood due to the severity of the disease and quality of life concerns.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Lagotto storage disorder is an inherited metabolic disorder affecting dogs. Dogs with this disease produce inadequate amounts of an enzyme which plays an important role in degradation, storage, and removal of cellular material from cells. As a result, this material accumulates in a variety of body’s cells, including those of the nervous system. The accumulation of this material results in an adult-onset progressive neurological disease most commonly presenting between 1 and 5 years of life. Clinical signs of neurological dysfunction in affected dogs include abnormal gait, weak or absent reflexes, limb weakness, behavioral changes, abnormal movement of the eyes (nystagmus), aggression, restlessness, and depression. The speed of disease progression varies, but most affected dogs are euthanized months to years after initial clinical signs due to quality of life concerns.",

Affected dogs often present at around four to eight months of age with signs of discomfort when eating or chewing caused by abnormal bone proliferation of the mandible, occipital and temporal skull bones, and/or the tympanic bulla (the bony structure housing the middle and inner ear). Other clinical signs of craniomandibular osteopathy include swelling around the jaw, difficulty opening mouth, drooling, fever, and difficulty holding food or toys with the mouth. Most dogs experience a cessation of bony growth around one year of age and the growth may recede or resolve in some cases with or without treatment. Although most cases of craniomandibular osteopathy are non-fatal, jaw pain in affected dogs may result in a reluctance to eat and secondary malnutrition. In some cases, pain and malnutrition may influence caregivers to pursue euthanasia due to quality of life concerns.",

Craniomandibular osteopathy is inherited in an autosomal incomplete dominant manner in dogs meaning that dogs only need to inherit one copy of the mutated gene to be at an increased risk of developing the disease. Though the disease is most commonly seen in dogs having two copies of the mutated gene, carrier dogs can also experience abnormal bony proliferation. Thus, dogs that have one or two mutant copies of the gene are considered at-risk for craniomandibular osteopathy. When carriers of this mutation are bred with another dog that also is a carrier of the same mutation, there is risk of having affected pups. For each pup that is born to this pairing, there is a 25% chance that the puppy will inherit two copies of the mutation and a 50% chance that the puppy will inherit one copy of the mutation and, in either case, may be susceptible to craniomandibular osteopathy. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups when bred to a dog that is also clear for this mutation.",

Affected dogs typically present around 6-7 weeks of age with severe exercise-induced weakness leading to collapse. During episodes of weakness dogs will have decreased reflexes in all limbs and a short-strided gait that progressively worsens until they collapse. Weakness resolves after rest and dogs are clinically normal between episodes of weakness. Dogs develop resistance to treatments used for a similar, acquired form of the disease known as myasthenia gravis, and may be humanely euthanized within 3 months of age due to disease severity.",

This mutation is found in many breeds of dog, though it is not clear whether all dogs carrying two copies of the mutation will develop the disease. The variable presentation between breeds suggests that there are environmental or other genetic factors responsible for modifying disease expression. The average age of onset for dogs with degenerative myelopathy is approximately nine years of age. The disease affects the white matter tissue of the spinal cord and is considered the canine equivalent to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease) found in humans. Affected dogs usually present in adulthood with gradual muscle atrophy and loss of coordination typically beginning in the hind limbs due to degeneration of the nerves. The condition is not typically painful for the dog, but will progress until the dog is no longer able to walk. The gait of dogs affected with degenerative myelopathy can be difficult to distinguish from the gait of dogs with hip dysplasia, arthritis of other joints of the hind limbs, or intervertebral disc disease. Late in the progression of disease, dogs may lose fecal and urinary continence and the forelimbs may be affected. Affected dogs may fully lose the ability to walk 6 months to 2 years after the onset of symptoms. Affected medium to large breed dogs can be difficult to manage and owners often elect euthanasia when their dog can no longer support weight in the hind limbs. Affected small breed dogs often progress more slowly than affected large breed dogs and owners may postpone euthanasia until the dog is paraplegic.",

The risk for excessive and spontaneous bleeding can range from mild to severe. The most common symptoms in affected dogs are recurrent nose bleeds and excessive bleeding of the gums when a dog sheds its teeth or chews on hard objects. Affected dogs can also bruise easily and get blood filled masses (hematomas) under their skin and within muscles with mild trauma. They may have internal bleeding and bloody or dark tarry feces. Dogs may show signs of lameness or stiffness if bleeding in the joints is present. Although dogs with this disorder are at risk for spontaneous hemorrhage and internal bleeding, affected dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted. Veterinarians performing surgery on known affected dogs should have ready access to blood banked for transfusions.  Dogs can have a normal lifespan with this condition although they are susceptible to life-threatening bleeding with an accidental injury or any surgical procedure.",

The disease rapidly progresses from generalized muscle weakness and frequent episodes of collapse to complete inability to stand or even raise their heads within 4 weeks of initial presentation. Dogs that are able to stand have an arched back and neck and stiff gait.

Signs of pain in the eye include excessive blinking, tearing and redness. If left untreated, the increased pressure in the eye leads to optic nerve damage and the gradual loss of vision. Dogs with glaucoma are at risk for lens luxation. Symptoms of lens luxation include excessive blinking, squinting and tearing of the eye. Dislocation of the lens can occur in both the forward and backward position within the eye, but dislocation in the forward position is more common and serious.

As the pressure in the eye increases, the eyeball increases in size and is painful. Signs of pain in the eye include excessive blinking, tearing and redness. If left untreated, the increased pressure in the eye leads to optic nerve damage and the gradual loss of vision. Dogs with glaucoma are at risk for lens luxation. Symptoms of lens luxation include excessive blinking, squinting and tearing of the eye. Dislocation of the lens can occur in both the forward and backward position within the eye, but dislocation in the forward position is more common and serious.

As the disease progresses, cone photoreceptor cells also degenerate resulting in complete blindness.

Symptoms typically present in the first few months of life, but some dogs may not show signs of disease until later in life. The first signs of disease have been reported in dogs up to 12 years of age, but most dogs will develop signs of the disease by 6 years of age. During episodes, dogs often display a fever and are typically lame in the swollen limb(s), lethargic, anorexic, and irritable. Though less common, joints of wrist, knee, hip, or jaw may also exhibit swelling. Episodes typically resolve on their own within 24-48 hours, but with treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs they may resolve faster. While affected dogs typically lead normal lives when not having episodes, they are predisposed to renal amyloidosis which leads to kidney failure. Shar-pei dogs with a padded (meatmouth) muzzle appear to be predisposed to developing this condition.",

Though clinical signs are most commonly seen in dogs having two copies of the mutated gene, carrier dogs can also show signs of autoinflammatory disease. Thus, dogs that have one or two mutant copies of the gene are considered at-risk for shar-pei autoinflammatory disease. When carriers of this mutation are bred with another dog that also is a carrier of the same mutation, there is risk of having affected pups. For each pup that is born to this pairing, there is a 25% chance that the puppy will inherit two copies of the mutation and a 50% chance that the puppy will inherit one copy of the mutation and, in either case, may be susceptible to autoinflammatory disease. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers is not recommended.

Affected dogs exhibit clinical signs of generalized neurologic disease including weakness, loss of muscle tone, muscle atrophy, awkward high-stepping gait in the hind limbs, decreased reflexes, abnormal bark sounds and increased breathing sounds due to paralysis of the larynx. The average age of onset for affected dogs is six years of age, though the age of onset is variable and can range from 1-10 years of age. With time, the disease may progress to the point that affected dogs are unable to bear weight or walk.",

Polyneuropathy (Leonberger type 2) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in dogs meaning that dogs only need to inherit one copy of the mutated gene to be at-risk for the disease. Each pup that is born to a parent carrying one copy of the mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting one copy of the GJA9 gene mutation and being at-risk for the disease. If both parents are affected, the chance of having affected offspring increases to 75-100%. Because symptoms may not appear until adulthood and not all dogs with the mutation develop disease, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups due to this mutation. However, because there are multiple types of polyneuropathy caused by mutations in other genes, a normal result in GJA9 does not exclude polyneuropathy in a pedigree.",

The extension locus encodes the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (MSHR; also known as MC1R). This receptor controls the level of tyrosinase within melanocytes. Tyrosinase is the enzyme involved in synthesis of melanin in the hair of animals. High levels of tyrosinase result in the production of eumelanin (dark colors such as brown or black) and low levels of tyrosinase results in the production of phaeomelanin (light colors such as red, yellow or cream). The wild-type allele, E, corresponds to dark pigmentation in E/E or E/e cats while two copies of the e variant results in light pigmentation, or the Amber phenotype. The variants of the MC1R gene are expressed in an autosomal recessive manner with E being dominant to and expressed over e. The other MC1R variant is the e^r variant found in Russet colored Burmese cats and the e^r variant is recessive to E. However, it is not known if e or e^r variants show any dominance to each other, but a compound heterozygote (e/e^r) likely has a light-colored coat. In addition, the cat's coat color is also dependent on other genes in the cat genome including loci O, B, A and C.",

Affected cats present within the first few months of life with  a variety of progressive clinical signs associated with the disruption of neurological signals to muscles including progressive muscle weakness, head bobbing and limb tremors, megaesophagus, protrusion of shoulder blades, abnormal gait, difficulty eating and swallowing and rapid fatigue with exercise. Due to weakness of muscles associated with swallowing, affected cats are at high risk of aspirating food or water, resulting in potentially life-threatening pneumonia or choking events. In a study of Sphynx and Devon Rex cats, about 2% of Devon Rex were found to be carriers of the COLQ gene mutation while less than 1% of Sphynx cats were found to be carriers.",

CMS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier cats do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected kittens. Each kitten that is born to a pairing of two carrier parents has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the COLQ gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected kittens, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Cats that are not carriers of this mutation have no increased risk of having affected kittens for this specific form of the disease.

Dogs with two copies of the associated APRT gene mutation are predisposed to elevated levels of an insoluble compound called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) in the urine. Increased urinary 2,8-DHA, places dogs at high risk for crystal or stone formation throughout the urinary tract including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and/or urethra. Dogs with this form of urolithiasis can present at nearly any age with symptoms of recurrent urinary tract inflammation, which include frequent urination, blood in the urine, and straining to urinate. They may also have loss of appetite, lethargy, weakness, vomiting and pain. Urinary stones in the bladder can cause urinary tract infections or more seriously, blockage of the urethra. In addition, blockages of urine flow at any location in the urinary tract place dogs at risk of kidney damage. Both male and female dogs can be affected, but obstruction of urine flow is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Not all dogs with mutations in both copies of the APRT gene will have symptoms of disease, though they will have increased 2,8-DHA excretion in the urine. Feeding of a specialized diet may be helpful in preventing stones in affected dogs.",

        "detailedSummary" : "Each blood group system consists of a set of blood types, each of which corresponds to a particular antigen (usually a glycoprotein) on the surface of red blood cells. The different types within a system are the result of the action of different alleles at a locus that usually encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the creation of the feature of the glycoprotein unique to that blood type. In domestic cats, the CMAH gene is responsible for the different blood groups. The ABC blood group system consists of the three serotypes A, B and C (also called AB). Mismatches can cause acute hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolysis of the newborn (neonatal isoerythrolysis, NI). As blood types B and C are inherited recessively to A, breeders need to know the genotype to predict blood types in offspring and avoid NI. Cats possess naturally occurring antibodies against the blood antigens that they lack. Blood type B cats have strong antibodies against A and blood type A cats have weak antibodies against B, while blood type C cats have no antibodies since they express both A and B antigens. Kittens that are A or C blood types will receive antibodies against their own blood type during nursing to a blood type B mother causing hemolysis in the kitten, which leads to lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, collapse, and death.",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the CMAH gene will reliably determine the blood group in cats. Determining a cat’s blood type is important for blood group compatibility and preventing hemolysis during transfusions and in breeding to prevent neonatal isoerythrolysis. Blood type A is the most common among all cat breeds, while blood type C is the most rare, found mainly in Ragdolls, Devon Rex, and British shorthairs. Determining the blood groups of a breeding pair will allow breeders to avoid breeding a queen with B blood group to toms of either blood groups A or C to avoid NI in the kittens. NOTE: The ABC Blood Group System interpretation is based off of three variants (b1, b2 and ac). Other blood group variants have been identified and associated with specific breeds, such as the Ragdoll. Definitive bloodtyping should be done by agglutination or other similar testing methods.",

        "detailedSummary" : "The KRT71 gene is known to be involved in coat and hair phenotypes in many mammals. Three variant alleles are known. Two copies of the hr mutation are found in most Sphynx cats and Kohana cats and produces hairlessness. However, about 24% of Sphynx cats studied showed only one copy of the recessive hr mutation, but yet are hairless. This finding supports that there is likely another, unknown mutation in the KRT71 gene that contributes to hairlessness in these cats. Other mutations in the KRT71 gene are known, including the R locus re variant found in the Devon Rex cat.  Two copies of the re mutation is fixed in most Devon Rex cats and produces a curly coat. Outcrossing of Devon Rex cats has demonstrated that cats with only one copy of the re mutation and one copy of the wildtype R gene sequence, do not have curly coats and exhibit typical, straight coats. The Sphynx cat may carry one hairless (hr) mutation and one copy of the re variant; the hr variant is allelic and dominant to the re mutation found in the Devon Rex. The third variant, SR, is found in the Selkirk Rex cat. Selkirk Rex cats with one copy or two copies of the dominant SR variant are curly.  In one study, about 25% of curly Selkirk Rex cats had two copies of the SR variant, while about 75% of curly Selkirk Rex cats had one copy of the SR variant.  All Selkirk Rex cats with straight coats showed two copies of the R wildtype gene sequence. This allelic series shows the following dominance: SR > R > hr > re.",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the KRT71 gene will reliably determine the genotypes of cats with various coat phenotypes. The hr variant causing hairlessness in Sphynx cats is known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Therefore, Sphynx cats that have two copies of the hr variant are hairless. Cats that carry one copy of the hr variant may also be hairless due to also carrying a copy of the recessive re (R) locus mutation or a copy of an unknown KRT71 gene mutation. Because the SR variant in Selkirk cats is dominant, one or two copies of the SR variant will produce a curly coat. The re variant causing curly coats in Devon Rex cats is known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Therefore, Devon Rex cats that are curly will have two copies of the re variant. Overall coat phenotype may also be determined by other mutations in KRT71 or in other genes in the cat genome.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPSVI) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder affecting cats. Affected cats have insufficient activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, also called arylsulfatase B (ARSB), which is responsible for breaking down glycosaminoglycans, specifically dermatan sulfate. In affected cats, there is an accumulation of breakdown products in cells causing variable medical problems from severe to clinically mild symptoms. Cats with the c.1558G>A mutation show a mild phenotype, characterized only by an increase in ARSB activity leading to rapid breakdown of this enzyme.  Cats homozygous for this mutation do not show any other phenotypic symptoms, with normal growth and typical outward appearances, and do not show the joint degeneration common in other forms of MPS VI. This variant appears to have little clinical consequence unless found in the presence of the Siamese ARSB mutation.",

        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the ARSB gene will reliably determine whether a cat is a genetic carrier of the lysosomal storage disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type 6 (MPSVI). MPSVI is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier cats do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected kittens. Each kitten that is born to a pairing of two carrier parents has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the ARSB gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to monitor this mutation in breeding lines, genetic testing is recommended. Cats that are not carriers of this mutation have no increased risk of having affected kittens for this specific form of the disease. However, this disease shows genetic heterogeneity in that there are other breeds, such as the Siamese cat, that have MPSVI due to a different mutation. Cats that are compound heterozygotes for the Siamese mutation and the mild form variant have more severe clinical features than cats that are homozygous for the mild form variant. The presence of heterogeneity demonstrates that a normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic disease or trait.",

        "detailedSummary" : "The KIT gene impacts feline coat color by modifying the expression of the pigments, eumelanin and phaeomelanin, in the hair resulting in absence of pigmentation. Three variants in the KIT gene have been identified. One variant, w^s, is a full-length insertion of a FERVI element into the KIT gene. The second variant, W, is an insertion of a FERVI-LTR into the KIT gene. The third variant, w^g, is a mutation in KIT that results in white gloves in certain breeds. The variants of the KIT gene are expressed in an autosomal co-dominant manner with W being dominant to and expressed over w^s, w^g, or w, the wildtype allele. Cats with W/W, W/w^s, W/w or W/w^g genotypes show complete penetrance for absence of coat color pigmentation (white coat) and incomplete penetrance for deafness and iris hypopigmentation. Cats that have two copies of w^s or are heterozygous with the wildtype w allele (w^s/w) show variable amounts of white spotting. Cats that have two copies of w^g show limited white on the paws (white gloves). However, for the white spotting phenotype, the cat's base coat color is dependent on other genes in the cat genome including loci A, O, B, E and C. This allelic series shows the following dominance: W > w^s > w > w^g.  In addition, there is heterogeneity in white spotting, as other breeds may show white gloves who do not have the w^g variant.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "GM2 gangliosidosis, type II is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder affecting cats. Affected cats have insufficient activity of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase B, which is responsible for breaking down specific carbohydrates in the cells. As a result, there is an accumulation of a glycoprotein, GM2 ganglioside, in cells, especially cells of the brain and nervous system. Affected cats typically present with symptoms of neurologic disease around 2 months of age. Initially symptoms begin as head and limb tremors, loss of balance and abnormal eye movements. Symptoms progress to inability to walk around 4 months of age. Hypothermia and difficulty urination may also be seen. Once an affected cat begins to show signs of the disease, the disease progression is rapid and cats will die by 7-10 months of age if not euthanized.",

GM2 gangliosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in cats meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier cats do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected kittens. Each kitten that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the HEXB gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected kittens, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Cats that are not carriers of this specific mutation have no increased risk of having affected kittens. However, this disease shows genetic heterogeneity with other known mutations also resulting in GM2 gangliosidosis. Therefore, a normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic disease.",

Signs include skeletal muscle atrophy, gait disturbances, muscle tremor of mostly the hindquarters, and progressive limb weakness. By about 5 months of age, muscle atrophy is evident in all four limbs. Affected cats can survive into adulthood.",

In addition, cats with one copy or two copies of the F variant will also inherit an osteochondrodysplasia affecting the distal fore limbs, distal hind limbs and tail that may progress to degenerative joint disease. Although the phenotype is variable, there is evidence that homozygous cats with two copies of the F variant are more severely affected than heterozygous cats with one copy of the F variant. Therefore, the recommendation for breeding Scottish Fold cats is to breed typical eared-cats to heterozygous folded eared-cats to avoid producing homozygous mutant cats.",

Therefore, reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices and can be used to identify one or two copies of the F variant in Scottish Fold cats. In the absence of genetic testing, folded eared-cats should be bred to typical eared-cats to avoid the potential of producing severely affected kittens.

Affected cats lack an enzyme that is important in the production of thyroid hormone which is necessary for normal development and metabolism. Between the ages of 3 to 12 weeks, affected cats present with a failure to thrive, poor hair coat, mental dullness, and poor growth compared to littermates. Common signs of hypothyroidism in cats include dwarfism, delayed skeletal maturation, shortened and bowed limbs, rounded and flattened face, convex curvature of the spine, goiter formation, chronic constipation, protruding tongue, delayed tooth eruption, excessive skin folds, retention of kitten hair coat, and thickened, dry, and hyperpigmented skin. Affected cats also may experience a variety of neurological issues resulting in muscle weakness, tremors, abnormal gait, decreased reflexes, and seizures (which may continue even with thyroid hormone supplementation). However, if diagnosed early, most clinical signs will resolve with supplementation.",

Congenital hypothyroidism is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier cats do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected kittens. Each kitten that is born to a pairing of two carrier parents has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the TPO gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected kittens, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Cats that are not carriers of this mutation have no increased risk of having affected kittens for this specific form of the disease. A normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic disease.",

Dogs may show signs of lameness or stiffness if bleeding occurs in the joints or muscle. Less often, the bleeding may be severe enough to cause death. Due to the variable severity of the disorder, affected dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted.

Cleft palate and syndactyly (Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever type) is an inherited developmental disease affecting dogs. Affected dogs present at birth with facial deformities of variable severity which include incomplete fusion of the upper lip (clefts) under one or both nostrils which often extends to involve an incomplete fusion of the palate and an open connection between the nasal cavity and mouth. In addition to malformation of the face and mouth, most affected dogs also display partial or complete fusion of the third and fourth toes (syndactyly) on any or all of their feet.

At least one other genetic mutation (in the canine DLX6 gene) has also been associated with cleft palate in the Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever. Therefore, obtaining normal results on this ADAMTS20 gene test does not completely exclude cleft palate in a pedigree.

        "commonSymptoms" : "Intestinal cobalamin malabsorption (giant schnauzer type) is an inherited disease affecting dogs. Affected dogs are unable to make adequate amounts of a protein that plays a role in absorption of certain nutrients from the intestinal tract and kidneys, including the B vitamin, cobalamin. Symptoms begin as early as 6 to 12 weeks of age and include anorexia, lethargy, poor weight gain, poor muscle mass, and in rare circumstances, a severe neurological dysfunction called hepatic encephalopathy that can lead to altered mental state, seizures, coma and death. Affected dogs have increased levels of methylmalonic acid in their urine (a sign of cobalamin deficiency) from a young age as well as an increase in certain proteins in their urine. Decreased synthesis of blood cells in affected dogs results in anemia and decreased numbers of neutrophils. Affected dogs require cobalamin supplementation for life that results in disease remission for most animals within a few weeks. Though not associated with clinical disease, affected dogs will continue to pass increased amounts of certain proteins in the urine even with cobalamin supplementation.",

        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the AMN will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of intestinal cobalamin malabsorption (giant schnauzer type). Intestinal cobalamin malabsorption is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the AMN gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

Affected dogs are identified when they begin walking with non-progressive signs of neurological dysfunction caused by underdevelopment of a part of the brain known as the cerebellum, which plays an important role in coordinated movement. Clinical signs include tremors, reduced or absent reflexes, subtle high-stepping gait, involuntary abnormal eye movements, and rolling or leaning to one side. Neither behavior nor ability to learn are impaired in affected dogs.",

Dandy-Walker-like malformation is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the VLDLR gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended.

The SLC7A9 gene codes for a protein that allows the kidneys to transport cysteine and other amino acids from the urine. Normal kidneys reabsorb the amino acid cystine so that only small amounts pass into the urine, while cats with mutations of both copies of the SLC7A9 gene fail to reabsorb cystine allowing high amounts to pass into the urine, hence the name cystinuria. Males and females are equally affected with excess cysteine in the urine, but obstruction of urine flow by cystine stones is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Cats with cystinuria often have recurrent inflammation of the urinary tract and if not treated, urinary stones may result in urinary tract infections, blood in the urine, kidney failure and even death.",

Affected cats have insufficient activity of the glycogen branching enzyme which makes glycogen for energy. Deficiency of this enzyme results in accumulation of abnormal glycogen in the cells of the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Affected kittens typically are stillborn or die shortly after birth due to low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). If kittens are supplemented with glucose immediately after birth, clinical signs of disease may not be evident until about 5 months of age. Symptoms include fever, generalized muscle tremors, a “bunny hopping” gait, and muscle wasting. The disease progresses rapidly, and affected cats typically die in their first year of life from heart failure.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Epilepsy (Lafora type) is an inherited neurological disease affecting dogs. Affected dogs typically present after 5 years of age with progressive, partial to generalized seizures due to an abnormal accumulation of large carbohydrate molecules in the brain. As the disease progresses, affected dogs may display other clinical signs including vision loss, deafness, dementia, myoclonus (involuntary muscle jerks), aggression, tremors, “flybiting” behavior (attempting to catch nonexistent flies), jaw smacking, urinary and fecal incontinence, loss of house training, and/or abnormal gait. Excitement or nervousness, exposure to flickering lights, sudden sounds or movements may trigger seizure activity in some affected dogs. Seizures caused by this type of epilepsy are generally unresponsive to treatment, especially as the disease progresses. Affected dogs are typically euthanized by 10-12 years of age due to disease progression.",
        "testingSummary" : "",
        "detailedSummary" : "",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the NHLRC1 gene will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of epilepsy (Lafora type). Epilepsy (Lafora type) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the NHLRC1 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because symptoms do not appear until adulthood, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

        "detailedSummary" : "The ST (short tail) variant is found in the HES7 gene known to be associated with a bobbed tail in the Japanese Bobtail cat. The ST variant acts dominantly to disrupt feline vertebral column development, leading to absence of either one thoracic or lumbar vertebrae and misplacement of ribs. Cats that are homozygous for the ST variant (have two copies of the ST allele), have no additional abnormalities, but do have a more predictable shortened tail, considered ‘show quality’ as compared to cats that are heterozygous for the ST variant (have one copy of the ST allele and one copy of the st allele).",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the HES7 gene will reliably determine the number of copies of the ST variant.  The ST mutation causing bobbed tail in Japanese Bobtail cats is known to be inherited in an autosomal incomplete dominant manner. Therefore, Japanese Bobtail cats that have two copies of the ST variant have short tails that may be shorter than cats with one copy of the ST variant. There may be other genetic factors that influence tail length and genetic heterogeneity is known, as Manx cats have shortened tails but do not have the ST variant. Therefore, a normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic trait. ",

Affected dogs can show symptoms of vision loss or have signs of retinal disease on veterinary ophthalmologic exam by 3 years of age. However, age of onset varies significantly in PRA-crd4 affected dogs, and has been reported from 1 to 15 years of age. Mutations in the RPGRIP1 gene show incomplete penetrance, meaning that not all dogs inheriting two copies of the mutation develop clinical disease. This suggests that other unknown genetic or environmental factors may play a role in modifying disease development and progression. Although progression tends to be relatively slow, most affected dogs (especially those with an early age of onset) will progress to complete blindness.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Trapped neutrophil syndrome is an inherited disease affecting Border Collies. This disease affects the immune system and its ability to fight infection.  Affected dogs most commonly present between the ages of 6-12 weeks with signs of immune dysfunction. Symptoms of the disease are dependent on the specific infection that the dog is fighting and may include failure to thrive, poor growth, weight loss, lethargy, diarrhea and vomiting. Affected dogs may also present with active respiratory, skin, eye or ear infections.  Affected puppies are often smaller than normal littermates and can have a narrow, elongated, ferret-like head. Occasionally affected dogs can be mildly affected and not show signs of disease until 1 to 2 years of disease, but typically affected dogs die from an infection by four months of age.",

Cystine can be detected in the urine of dogs affected with Cystinuria (Newfoundland type) as early as two days of age, but symptoms may not appear until 6-8 months of age in males and even later in females. The SLC3A1 gene codes for a protein that allows the kidneys to transport cysteine and other amino acids from the urine. Normal kidneys reabsorb the amino acid cystine so that only small amounts pass into the urine, while dogs with mutation of both copies of the SLC3A1 gene fail to reabsorb cystine allowing high amounts to pass into the urine, hence the name cystinuria. Cystine can form crystals and/or stones in the urinary tract which can block the ureters or urethra and stop the normal flow of urine. Both male and female dogs have increased amounts of cysteine in the urine, but obstruction of urine flow is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Dogs with cystinuria often have recurrent inflammation of the urinary tract and if not treated, urinary stones can cause urinary tract infections, kidney failure, and even death.</p>",

This condition manifests as a combination of abnormal masses in the kidneys and the skin of both male and female dogs and also the uterus in female dogs. Affected dogs usually present around 6.5 years of age with small, firm bumps under the surface of the skin, more commonly located on the limbs and head. The kidney tumors often form nodular masses and cysts that can cause the kidneys to become enlarged, abnormally shaped and scarred. Affected dogs often show signs of chronic kidney disease which may include frequent urination, blood in the urine, frequent drinking, depression, inappetence and weight loss. The disease typically presents over the age of 5, and tumors may not develop until dogs are 9 to 11 years of age. The average age of death for affected dogs is 9.3 years due to renal failure or metastatic disease. Puppies that inherit two copies of the FLCN gene mutation most likely die very early in gestation; therefore, breeding two dogs with renal cystadenocarcinoma and nodular dermatofibrosis may result in reduced litter size.",

Affected dogs have insufficient activity of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which is responsible for breaking down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are an important component of connective tissue. In affected dogs there is an accumulation of breakdown products in cells causing abnormal growth and function of various different organ systems. Clinical signs of MPS VII are most commonly associated with accumulations in the bones and joints. Therefore, affected dogs typically present between 1 to 4 weeks of age with symptoms of bone and joint disease. Affected puppies have disproportionally large heads with short muzzles, broad faces and domed skulls. Other skeletal deformities include joint laxity and deformed, crooked legs resulting in an inability to walk. Affected puppies are smaller than their normal littermates and exhibit a failure to thrive. Affected dogs die on their own or are euthanized within the first 5 weeks of life.",

Cilia are microscopic, hair-like structures that line the nasal cavity, trachea, and bronchi of the respiratory system, the fluid filled cavities of the brain and portions of the reproductive tract. Normal cilia move in wave-like patterns to aid the movement of fluids in the brain and reproductive tracts and prevent large particles and pathogens from getting into the lungs. In PCD, affected dogs have cilia that are either malformed or do not move. Particles and pathogens cannot be removed from the upper respiratory tract and can lead to sinusitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. Affected dogs typically present a few days after birth with respiratory disease. Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and frequent respiratory infections. This disorder also causes immobility of sperm, therefore affected male dogs are sterile. Dogs with PCD may also have a transposition of organs in the thoracic and/or abdominal cavities, resulting in a mirror image of the normal placement of the heart and lungs and sometimes other organs. This transposition is called situs inversus and does not usually cause clinical problems. Dogs with this disorder can live for years if their chronic respiratory infections are managed.",

Each male pup that is born to a female dog known to be a carrier of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. Female dogs that are not carriers of this mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

The muscle cells of an affected dog are over-excitable, which causes muscles to remain contracted rather than relaxing after voluntary activity. Signs of the disorder usually present when puppies begin to walk. Their gait may appear stiff and uncoordinated and they may fall frequently. Affected dogs frequently have a “bunny hop” type gait. Episodes do not appear to be painful and the muscle stiffness may improve with increased exercise. Episodes can worsen with cold and excitement. Other features include enlargement of the muscles, abnormal posture, an upper jaw that is much longer than the lower jaw, and dental abnormalities. Dogs may also exhibit excessive panting and salivation, have an abnormal bark and loud raspy breathing, and have difficulty swallowing. Dogs with this disorder typically have a normal lifespan.",

        "detailedSummary" : "The D locus (Dilute) corresponds to a region of the MLPH gene that is important in determining coat color in dogs. This gene variant modifies the expression of the pigments,  eumelanin and phaeomelanin in the hair. A genetic variant within this gene results in a “diluting” or lightening of the coat color of dogs. Canine coat color determination is complex due to interactions of multiple genes responsible for both color and anatomic placement of the color. A dog with two variant copies of the MLPH gene will have a blue,  charcoal,  Isabella (lilac) or fawn coat color depending on the other coat color genes present in the individual. Disease Association Note: Variants of the D locus are sometimes responsible for a condition called color dilution alopecia,  black hair follicular dysplasia,  or blue Doberman syndrome (depending on the breed) because dilute coat color can be associated with development of alopecia (hair loss). The clinical presentation of alopecia associated with dilute coat color is variable within and between breeds; therefore only a portion of individuals carrying two copies of the MLPH gene variant will show hair loss with some breeds being much more likely to develop the condition. Though two copies of the MLPH gene variant are necessary to develop color dilution alopecia,  the variable presentation of this condition suggests that additional environmental or genetic factors contribute to the development of alopecia. Dogs affected with alopecia typically present with loss of hair between the ages of four months and two years. Hair of affected dogs can also appear dry and dull. The hair loss is caused by abnormal melanin storage in the hair,  which leads to breakage of the hair shaft and the lack of normal regrowth of hair. Dogs with this condition can also be affected with recurrent bacterial skin infections originating in the hair follicles (folliculitis). Given that the modifying environmental or genetic factors responsible for alopecia are unknown,  the only way to prevent color dilution alopecia is to avoid transmitting the dilute coat color variant to offspring in susceptible breeds.",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the <em>MLPH</em> gene will reliably determine the number of copies of the color dilution gene variant that a dog carries. Coat color dilution associated with this particular <em>MLPH</em> variant is known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs. Carrier dogs do not display a dilute color and are not at risk for alopecia but when bred with another dog that also is a carrier of the same variant, there is a 25% chance of having pups with diluted coat color that may also be susceptible to alopecia in some breeds. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Dogs that are not carriers of this variant have no increased chance of having pups with diluted coat color or alopecia.",

Affected dogs have insufficient activity of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, which is responsible for breaking down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are an important component of tissues throughout the body. In affected dogs there is an accumulation of breakdown products in cells causing abnormal growth and function of many different organ systems. Affected dogs typically present after 4 to 6 months of life with initial symptoms of bone and joint disease including joint laxity, delayed growth, skeletal deformities and pain on handling. Clinical signs of MPS I are most commonly associated with accumulations in the heart, bones, joints, nervous system and eyes. Other features of MPS I include cloudy eyes, arched back, stiff gait, umbilical hernia and a characteristic upturned nose. Dogs usually die due to complications of the disease or are humanely euthanized by 2-3 years of age.",

Affected dogs may also bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, bleed from the mouth when juvenile teeth are lost, or show signs of lameness or stiffness if bleeding occurs in the joints or muscle. A mildly affected dog may present with easy and excessive bruising and frequent nosebleeds. There is significant risk for prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma, and in some cases, the bleeding may be severe enough to cause death.

This dog did not demonstrate clinical signs related to platelet abnormalities however, recognizing a congenital cause for macrothrombocytopenia is important because both thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytosis can be associated with clinically important diseases. In addition, some blood analyzer machines can misinterpret macrothrombocytes as red blood cells, thus further complicating diagnoses. Though usually asymptomatic, humans with May-Hegglin anomaly have been reported to have issues with blood clotting leading to bruising and spontaneous bleeding.

Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII, which is an essential protein needed for normal blood clotting. Affected dogs may bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, bleed from the mouth when juvenile teeth are lost, and experience prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. Dogs may show signs of lameness or stiffness if bleeding occurs in the joints or muscle. Less often, the bleeding may be severe enough to cause death. Due to the variable severity of the disorder, affected dogs may not be identified until a surgery is performed or trauma occurs at which time excessive bleeding is noted. Veterinarians performing surgery on known affected dogs should have ready access to blood banked for transfusions. Most dogs will have a normal lifespan with this condition despite increased blood clotting times.",

By 5 months of age dogs have complete loss of night vision and also show visual deficits in bright light. Other signs of progressive retinal atrophy involve changes in reflectivity and appearance of a structure behind the retina called the tapetum that can be observed on a veterinary eye exam.

Affected puppies present around 3 to 4 weeks of life with renal failure due to excessive crystal formation in the kidneys. Symptoms of acute renal failure can include inappetence, vomiting, lethargy, decreased urine production, abdominal pain, blood in the urine and death.

The age of onset is variable depending on whether a dog has one or two copies of the mutation, but affected dogs typically present between 2 to 8 years of age with sudden signs of eye irritation. Symptoms of lens luxation include excessive blinking, squinting and tearing of the eye. Dislocation of the lens can occur in both the forward and backward position within the eye, but dislocation in the forward position is more common and serious.

Abnormal amounts of protein can be detected in the urine between two and three months of age at which time both affected male and carrier female puppies are noted to be smaller and thinner than their unaffected littermates. Affected dogs begin showing signs of chronic kidney failure between 7 and 15 months of age. Symptoms of chronic kidney disease include excessive thirst and urination, vomiting, inappetence, weight loss, weakness and fatigue. If drinking excessively, some dogs may also inappropriately urinate in the house or in a crate. Due to its X-linked inheritance, male dogs are more frequently affected with this disease than female dogs. Female dogs which carry this mutation can also show signs of kidney disease however, disease progression in females is generally slower with some dogs showing minimal to no signs of kidney disease.

        "commonSymptoms" : "Hyperuricosuria is an inherited condition of the urinary system affecting several breeds of dog. The SLC2A9 gene codes for a protein that allows the kidneys to transport uric acid from the urine. Dogs with mutations in both copies of the SLC2A9 gene are predisposed to have elevated levels of uric acid in the urine, hence the name hyperuricosuria. Uric acid can form crystals and/or stones (uroliths) in the urinary tract. Dogs with hyperuricosuria most commonly present with symptoms of recurrent urinary tract inflammation, which include frequent urination, blood in the urine, and straining to urinate. They may also have loss of appetite, lethargy, weakness, vomiting and pain. Urinary stones in the bladder can cause urinary tract infections or more seriously, blockage of the urethra. Both male and female dogs can be affected, but obstruction of urine flow is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Although an x-ray can be used to exclude other types of stones, urate stones cannot typically be seen using x-rays and must be evaluated by ultrasound. Not all dogs with mutations in both copies of the SLC2A9 gene will have symptoms of disease, though they will have increased uric acid excretion in the urine.",

PRA-prcd occurs as a result of degeneration of both rod and cone type photoreceptor cells of the retina, which are important for vision in dim and bright light, respectively. Evidence of retinal disease in affected dogs can first be seen on an electroretinogram around 1.5 years of age for most breeds, but most affected dogs will not show signs of vision loss until 3 to 5 years of age or later. The rod type cells are affected first and affected dogs will initially have vision deficits in dim light (night blindness) and loss of peripheral vision. Over time affected dogs continue to lose night vision and begin to show visual deficits in bright light. Other signs of progressive retinal atrophy involve changes in reflectivity and appearance of a structure behind the retina called the tapetum that can be observed on a veterinary eye exam. Although there is individual and breed variation in the age of onset and the rate of disease progression, the disease eventually progresses to complete blindness in most dogs. Other inherited disorders of the eye can appear similar to PRA-prcd. Genetic testing may help clarify if a dog is affected with PRA-prcd or another inherited condition of the eye.",

        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the PRCD gene will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of PRA-prcd. PRA-prcd is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of being a carrier of the PRCD gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because symptoms do not appear until adulthood, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups. However, because there are multiple types of PRA caused by mutations in other genes, a normal result in PRCD does not exclude PRA in a pedigree.",

        "detailedSummary" : "Variation in the SHH gene is known to be associated with pre-axial polydactyly in North American and British shorthair cats. Pre-axial polydactyly refers to an additional toe(s) towards the first toes (medially side) on the feet. The PD variants act dominantly to change the regulation of the SHH gene that is important for limb formation. Cats that are descendants from a cat given to Ernest Hemingway in the 1930’s have polydactyly due to inheritance of one or two copies of the PD^H variant.  Cats that are homozygous for the PD^H variant (have two copies of the PD^H allele) or heterozygous (have one copy of the PD^H variant and one copy of the wildtype, pd allele) will have polydactyly, with about 80% of cats showing polydactyly in only the forelimbs and about 20% of cats showing polydactyly of all four limbs. Two different variants of SHH have been found in British shorthair cats with polydactyly. Cats that are homozygous for either PD^1 or PD^2 variants, heterozygous (have one copy of either PD^1 or PD^2 variants and one copy of the pd wildtype allele), or compound heterozygotes with one copy of PD^1 and one copy of PD^2, will have polydactyly. Most cats with one or two copies of the British variants will show polydactyly of all four limbs. Cats that have one copy of PD^1 or PD^2 and one copy of PD^H will presumably also show polydactyly.",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the SHH gene will reliably determine the number and specific PD variants in cats showing polydactyly. All known variants in SHH causing polydactyly in cats are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Therefore, cats that have two copies or one copy of these known variants will have polydactyly. Polydactyly shows genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, a normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic trait. ",

The SLC7A9 gene codes for a protein that allows the kidneys to transport cysteine and other amino acids from the urine. Normal kidneys reabsorb the amino acid cystine so that only small amounts pass into the urine, while cats with mutations of both copies of the SLC7A9 gene fail to reabsorb cystine allowing high amounts to pass into the urine, hence the name cystinuria. Males and females are equally affected with excess cysteine in the urine, but obstruction of urine flow by cystine stones is more common in males due to differences in anatomy. Cats with cystinuria often have recurrent inflammation of the urinary tract and if not treated, urinary stones may result in urinary tract infections, blood in the urine, kidney failure and even death.",

        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the SLC7A9 gene will reliably determine whether a cat is a genetic carrier of cystinuria, type B. Cystinuria, type B is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in cats meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier cats do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected kittens. Each kitten that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the SLC7A9 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected kittens, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Cats that are not carriers of this specific mutation have no increased risk of having affected kittens. However, this disease shows genetic heterogeneity with other known mutations in SLC7A9 also resulting in cystinuria. Therefore, a normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic disease.",

Affected dogs frequently present around 4 to 6 years of age with clouding of their corneas accompanied by pinpoint white to gray spots made up of an accumulation of a carbohydrate known as glycosaminoglycan. Some affected dogs will also display growth of new blood vessels across the surface of their corneas. The disease will typically progress to compromise vision.",

        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the CHST6 gene will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of macular corneal dystrophy. Macular corneal dystrophy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the CHST6 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "Hyperlipoproteinemia is an inherited metabolic disease affecting cats. The disease is caused by deficiency of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) resulting in the inability to breakdown fats (lipids) correctly. This results in high triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood. Affected cats are prone to coronary artery disease due to plaque buildup inside the arteries, which narrows the arteries and impedes blood flow (atherosclerosis). Additionally, cats may develop skin masses in areas of trauma or friction. Masses are composed of degenerating fat and inflammatory cells (xanthomas). These masses sometimes compress nerves causing muscle weakness and wasting. Affected cats should be fed a low-fat diet.",
        "testingSummary" : "",
        "detailedSummary" : "",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the LPL gene will reliably determine whether a cat is a genetic carrier of hyperlipoproteinemia. Hyperlipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in cats meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier cats do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected kittens. Each kitten that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the LPL gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected kittens, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Cats that are not carriers of this specific mutation have no increased risk of having affected kittens. However, a normal result does not exclude a different mutation in this gene or any other gene that may result in a similar genetic disease.",

        "commonSymptoms" : "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders. Affected dogs lack a specific enzyme necessary for normal metabolism. As a result, there is an abnormal accumulation of waste compounds primarily in the cells of the nervous system, leading to a range of nervous system disorders. Dogs affected with NCL (Tibetan terrier type) present with progressive loss of vision and behavior changes beginning around 4 to 7 years of age. Symptoms include a lack of muscle coordination, abnormal gait and difficulty in balancing and jumping. Affected dogs may also display aimless wandering behavior with episodes of confusion, depression, aggression, seizures and frequent barking. These symptoms become more frequent and severe over time. As the disease progresses, dogs may lose sensory skills and vision. Signs of dementia may include loss of learned behavior, irritability and aggression. There is currently no treatment for the disease.",

        "detailedSummary" : "",
        "testingTips" : "Genetic testing of the ATP13A2 gene will reliably determine whether a dog is a genetic carrier of NCL (Tibetan terrier type). NCL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in dogs meaning that they must receive two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. In general, carrier dogs do not have features of the disease but when bred with another carrier of the same mutation, there is a risk of having affected pups. Each pup that is born to this pairing has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance inheriting one copy and being a carrier of the ATP13A2 gene mutation. Reliable genetic testing is important for determining breeding practices. Because symptoms do not appear until adulthood, genetic testing should be performed before breeding. In order to eliminate this mutation from breeding lines and to avoid the potential of producing affected pups, breeding of known carriers to each other is not recommended. Dogs that are not carriers of the mutation have no increased risk of having affected pups.",
